Simple real-time chat application using Socket.IO with React.js/TailwindCSS and Express.js with TypeScript and TypeORM (Postgres).

The README ends here because I'm too lazy to explain something I already did a long time ago, you're alone in that jungle of code. Thank you for reading! ❤️

## Context

> NOTE: This is a public update of the project and I want to be brief as I have already written more details about this project in the demo, more information below.

This is my second project developed and published in Node.js (still a noob) and the first one using Web Sockets through Socket.IO, just to test this technology. It was also my first try with TypeORM.

This, like many of my early projects, were private repositories as I felt insecure about the spaghetti code I was writing without much of a clue, and also because I didn't want to reveal potential security breaches. This is no longer a concern for me since at the end of the day they are learning projects and nothing else.

I've given myself the task of updating/refactoring some parts of the code to make it a bit more presentable in general (it's still spaghetti code), especially in the backend where I also updated the dependencies. I tried doing the same on the client trying to migrate to Vite.js but it was a bit of a hassle so I just kept what works, out of laziness (I'd rather start from scratch).

There are still a lot of problems and things that I would definitely do differently, but due to the nature of the project (just to learn) I prefer to keep it as it is and focus on new and interesting challenges.

You can see some more information in the "About" section.

Now yes, thanks for reading! ❤️
