              <p>Hi! my name is Luis Portillo, Venezuelan Fullstack Web Developer (DevCorvus), the only developer involved in this project.</p>
              <p>Pigeon Club is a simple public chat project developed in order to test the functionalities and capabilities of Web Sockets.</p>
              <p>To make this process easier, especially around communication with client, the Socket.IO library was used in conjunction with Express (TypeScript).</p>
              <p>The connection to the database (Postgres) is made through TypeORM.</p>
              <p>Due to the scale of the project (Just to learn) there are clear limitations of functionality that in terms of learning would be redundant. Even so, there is a relatively solid structure in what is achieved, with all the essential sections such as authentication / authorization (JWT), validation, sanitization, among other basic measures.</p>
              <p>The implementation of "Rooms" is pending for me to add in the future, either in this project or other projects related to this technology, I decided to postpone said implementation for a mere matter of time.</p>
              <p>As for the client, React with Redux (Toolkit) and TailwindCSS was the base, as well as a small cocktail of libraries that I decided to implement in some redundant sections and thus experiment a little with them.</p>
              <p>Broadly speaking, it has been a very interesting project to carry out and from which I have learned a lot of things as well as reinforced previous knowledge and I am interested in continuing to explore the world of Web Sockets or other alternatives in the future.</p>
              <p>I hope this is a project to your liking, user, although it should be clarified that its purpose is not intended for the general public, only as a technical test carried out in order to learn and develop my skills.</p>
              <p>If you want to contact me in relation to this project or other reasons, I leave the following means of contact at your disposal: <a className="text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-500 focus:text-indigo-500 transition" href="https://devbanner.herokuapp.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevBanner's Contact Page (My personal Blog)</a>.</p>
